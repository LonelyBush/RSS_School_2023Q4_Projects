# RSS_School_2023Q4_Projects

Hello, my name is Nikita. 
Here I publish my web projects that I made while going through **JavaScript/Front-end 2023Q4** course from [Rolling Scopes School](https://rs.school/)

## Stage #1
### 1. Coffee-House

This is a landing page that was created based on ready-made [design solution in Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/SAoBmuOqTfguehdT4IFRxQ/Coffee-House?node-id=0-1&t=ohzpOnJtSTBZSb3W-0), which was provided by the RS school.
The project design was made in 3 different versions: for mobile phones, for tablets and for desktop computers

**Used technologies:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

**Deploy:** https://lonelybush.github.io/RSS_School_2023Q4_Projects/coffee-house/index.html


### 2. Hangman game

Hangman is a classic word game in which you must find the correct answer by guessing letters one at a time.

Design and overall functionality is my own implementation

**Used technologies:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

**Deploy**: https://lonelybush.github.io/RSS_School_2023Q4_Projects/hangman-task/

### 3. Nonograms game

This is final project for **Stage #1** of the **JavaScript/Front-end 2023Q4 course**.

Nonograms is a puzzle game to reveal a hidden picture by looking at the number clues. The clues are given at the top and left side of the grid. Each number in these clue defines a block of black cell. A number indicates an unbroken line of black cells, and they are in the same order as the lines. These puzzles are often black and white—describing a binary image—but they can also be colored.
