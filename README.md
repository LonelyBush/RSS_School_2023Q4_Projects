## Async-Race
The main task is to manage a collection of cars, control their engines and display racing statistics in a fun interactive SPA. Develop and gain skill with REST-API and implement CRUD operations for cars using the provided server mock.

To run this SPA you need to start localy this [server-repo](https://github.com/mikhama/async-race-api)
